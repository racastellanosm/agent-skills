# QRSPI Methodology Agent Skill (`qrspi-methodology`)

An autonomous engineering methodology skill implementing the deterministic 5-phase **QRSPI** standard (**Q**uestion, **R**esearch, **S**tructure, **P**lan, **I**mplement) for AI coding assistants.

## 🎯 What is QRSPI?

QRSPI enforces a strict phase-gated engineering process to eliminate hallucinations, prevent regressions, and enforce architectural integrity:

```
[ 1. QUESTION ] ➔ [ 2. RESEARCH ] ➔ [ 3. STRUCTURE ] ➔ [ 4. PLAN ] ➔ [ 5. IMPLEMENT ]
```

1. **Question**: Socratic stress-testing, failure-mode probing, and zero lazy questions (codebase pre-checked).
2. **Research**: Discover codebase ground truth, dependencies, and blast radius before modifying files.
3. **Structure**: Define architectural contracts, invariants, types, and trade-offs.
4. **Plan**: Formulate an atomic step-by-step checklist with verifiable commands.
5. **Implement**: Execute sequentially with automated lint/test validation.

> 🛑 **Invariant: Exactly One Phase per Turn.**  
> The agent pauses execution and ends its turn at every single phase, presenting its findings, questions, or plan for explicit user approval before advancing.

## 🛡️ Core Engineering Invariants & Principles

To prevent LLMs from silently guessing, overengineering, or causing orthogonal code regressions, QRSPI enforces three non-negotiable principles:

1. **Think Before Coding (Don't Guess. Surface Confusion. Present Trade-Offs.):**
   * *State Assumptions Explicitly:* Never pick an interpretation silently and run with it.
   * *Stop on Confusion:* If requirements or code ground truths conflict, stop and ask immediately.
   * *Push Back When Warranted:* Proactively propose simpler, standard alternatives if an overcomplicated approach is requested.
2. **Simplicity First (Occam's Engineering. Zero Speculative Bloat.):**
   * *Minimum Code:* Write only the minimal code that cleanly solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
   * *No Single-Use Abstractions:* Never introduce unneeded interfaces, factories, or layers for single-use logic.
   * *The Senior Engineer Simplicity Test:* If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it into the most direct solution.
3. **Surgical Changes (Touch Only What You Must. Zero Orthogonal Edits.):**
   * *Blast Radius Containment:* Touch only the files and symbols strictly required to fulfill the task.
   * *Zero Orthogonal Refactoring:* Do NOT "improve", reformat, or re-indent adjacent functions or files that aren't broken.
   * *Preserve Comments & Style:* Never delete or strip existing comments/docstrings. Match the existing codebase idioms strictly.
   * *Dead Code Policy:* If unrelated dead code is observed, record it in the execution log—never delete it silently.

## 🧠 Memory, Modular Persistence & Team Handoffs

To eliminate gigantic monolithic documents and optimize token usage, each feature session is organized into a modular folder with 1 Markdown document per QRSPI stage:

```text
my-project/
└── .qrspi/                                         # Configurable root (.qrspi/, .docs/, .implementations/, .sessions/)
    ├── INDEX.md                                    # Master registry & living ADR
    └── 2026-08-21-auth-v2-migration/               # Dedicated feature session directory directly under root
        ├── 1-question.md                           # Scope, requirements (FR/NFR), and acceptance criteria
        ├── 2-research.md                           # Codebase discoveries, dependencies, and blast radius
        ├── 3-structure.md                          # Contracts, types, and architectural decisions
        ├── 4-plan.md                               # Atomic step-by-step checklist with test commands
        └── 5-implement.md                          # Step execution log, test results, and final sign-off
```

### ⚡ Advantages of the Modular Architecture:
1. **Up to 80% Token Savings:** An implementation subagent only loads `3-structure.md` and `4-plan.md` into context, rather than carrying the entire verbose research history.
2. **Efficient Human Review:** 
   - **Design Review:** Architects and tech leads only review `3-structure.md`.
   - **Pull Request Review:** The team reviews `5-implement.md` to verify test execution and linter output.
3. **Living ADR & Configurable Destination:** Maintains the centralized index of architectural decisions. Defaults to `.qrspi/`, with configurable support for `.docs/`, `.implementations/`, or `.sessions/` defined in your project's `AGENTS.md`.

## ⚡ Dynamic Model Tiering & Cognitive Load Routing

QRSPI dynamically matches task complexity with the appropriate AI model weight to balance cost, token efficiency, and architectural reasoning:

| Phase | Cognitive Weight | Target Model Category | Function |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Question** | **MEDIUM** | Standard Reasoning (`Gemini 3.7 Flash` / `Claude 3.7 Sonnet` / `GPT-4o`) | Proactive Socratic probing, ambiguity clarification. |
| **2. Research** | **HIGH** | Deep Reasoning (`Gemini 3.1 Pro` / `Claude 3.7 Sonnet-Thinking` / `o3-mini`) | Codebase traversal, AST mapping, blast radius analysis. |
| **3. Structure** | **HIGH** | Deep Reasoning (`Gemini 3.1 Pro` / `Claude 3.7 Sonnet-Thinking` / `o1`) | Contract design, architectural invariants, trade-offs. |
| **4. Plan** | **HIGH** | Deep Reasoning (`Gemini 3.1 Pro` / `Claude 3.7 Sonnet-Thinking`) | Atomic task breakdown, test-first strategy. |
| **5. Implement** | **LOW / FAST** | Fast Execution (`Gemini 3.7 Flash` / `Claude 3.5 Haiku` / `GPT-4o-mini`) | Atomic file edits, test runner execution, linting. |
