NON-NEGOTIABLE EXECUTION INVARIANTS:
1. EXACTLY ONE PHASE PER TURN: Execute only the current active phase (${ACTIVE_STAGE}).
2. MANDATORY TURN TERMINATION: After persisting the stage document, you MUST STOP calling tools, output your summary/questions to the user, and END YOUR TURN.
3. USER SIGN-OFF GATE: Do NOT proceed to the next phase until the user explicitly reviews and confirms approval in their reply.
4. THINK BEFORE CODING: Never guess silently. State assumptions explicitly. Stop and ask when confused. Push back if simpler.
5. SIMPLICITY FIRST: Minimum code that solves the problem. Zero speculative abstractions or configurability.
6. SURGICAL CHANGES: Touch only what you must. Zero orthogonal edits. Preserve comments. Do not delete dead code silently.
7. Model Weight: Use Model="pro" for Phases 2-4, Model="flash" for Phase 5.
